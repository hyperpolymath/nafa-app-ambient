# === NAFA Containerfile (Deno Runtime) ===

# Multi-stage build for the NAFA server.
# Uses Chainguard's Deno image for minimal CVE surface.

# TODO: Migrate to Cerro Torre (hyperpolymath/cerro-torre) when Phase 1
#       ships with OCI image output. Cerro Torre provides:
#       - Provenance-verified packages from democratic governance
#       - Ada/SPARK tooling with formal verification
#       - Complete supply-chain transparency
#       See: https://github.com/hyperpolymath/cerro-torre
